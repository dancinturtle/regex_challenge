        <p class="small_header">In Django, we'll be using regular expressions for routing.</p>
        <p>Regex can also be handy in many situations, and most languages support some form of regex.  Some examples of uses for regex include text processing (think of chat bots or real language processing), data validation (like we have seen when working with form validation in Flask), and search queries.  It's a great skill to have, and the more profficient you become the more it will start to feel like a super power!</p>
        <p>But what is a regex, you might ask.  A regex is simply a pattern we can match to any string.  Find all the info you need to get started here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html">https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>In order to get started with regex in python, we must import the re library into our document:</p>
        <pre>import re</pre>
        <p>Regular expressions are preceeded by r, like so:</p>
        <pre>r"a"</pre>
        <p>This regex would match any string containing the letter a.</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at some more complete code. We'll use this function to test some regular expressions.  Don't try running the code yet, first, let's predict the output for the next few regular expressions.</p>
        <pre>
  import re

  def get_matching_words(regex):
      results = []
      words = [
          "baby",
          "baseball",
          "denver",
          "facetious",
          "issue",
          "mattress",
          "obsessive",
          "paranoia",
          "rabble",
          "union",
          "volleyball",
      ]
      for word in words:
          if re.search(regex, word):
              results.append(word)

      return results

  my_expression = r"a"
  print get_matching_words(my_expression)
        </pre>
        <p>What would our output be for this example? Predict the following: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>r"v"</li>
          <li>r"^[aeiou]"</li>
          <li>r"(\w)\1"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Write regular expressions that will produce the following output, and use the above code to test your regex:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>['issue', 'mattress', 'obsessive']</li>
            <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> Matches the literal "ss"</span><p class="answer">r"(s)\1"</p>

          <li>['baby']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> "." matches any character except for the new line, so this looks for a word with a "b", any character, then another "b"</span><p class="answer">r"b.b"</p>

          <li>['baby', 'baseball']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> "+" is a wildcard character meaning "one or more times", so this looks for a "b", one or more characters, then another "b".  All of the wildcard characters (and the next few problems cover more) apply to the one character immediately in front of them (so then is any number of "."s, not any number of "b."s)</span><p class="answer">r"b.+b"</p>

          <li>['baby', 'baseball', 'rabble']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> "*" is like "+", but it means "zero or more times".  This looks for a "b", any number of characters (including none), then another "b"</span><p class="answer">r"b.*b"</p>

          <li>['baby', 'rabble']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> "?" means that the preceeding character is matched 0 to 1 times, for example "."</span></span><p class="answer">r"b.?b"</p>

          <li>['facetious']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> This pattern matches a word that has all five vowels in order, regardless of how many letters are or are not between them</span></span></span><p class="answer">r"a.*e.*i.*o.*u"</p>

          <li>['issue', 'paranoia']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> Curly braces mean the pattern repeats that many times, so this is words that end with two vowels</span><p class="answer">r"[aeiou]{2}\b"</p>

          <li>['issue', 'paranoia', 'union']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> This pattern includes both "^" and "$", so it will only match full words.  It looks for words consisting of one or more letters from "regular expression"</span><p class="answer">r"(\w|^)(issue|paranoia|union)(\w|$)"</p>

          <li>['baby', 'union']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> Annoyingly, "^" means two different things; inside a character class, it stands for "not", so this will match words that don't have any of the letters from "regex"</span><p class="answer">r"^[^regex]*$"</p>

          <li>['volleyball']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> This matches any word where the double-letter appears twice</span><p class="answer">r"(\w)\1.*(\w)\1"</p>
