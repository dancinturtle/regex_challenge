        <p class="small_header">In Django, we'll be using regular expressions for routing.</p>
        <p>Regex can also be handy in many situations, and most languages support some form of regex.  Some examples of uses for regex include text processing (think of chat bots or real language processing), data validation (like we have seen when working with form validation in Flask), and search queries.  It's a great skill to have, and the more profficient you become the more it will start to feel like a super power!</p>
        <p>But what is a regex, you might ask.  A regex is simply a pattern we can match to any string.  Find all the info you need to get started here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html">https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>In order to get started with regex in python, we must import the re library into our document:</p>
        <pre>import re</pre>
        <p>Regular expressions are preceeded by r, like so:</p>
        <pre>r"a"</pre>
        <p>This regex would match any string containing the letter a.</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at some more complete code. We'll use this function to test some regular expressions.  Don't try running the code yet, first, let's predict the output for the next few regular expressions.</p>
        <pre>
  import re

  def get_matching_words(regex):
      results = []
      words = [
          "baby",
          "baseball",
          "denver",
          "facetious",
          "issue",
          "mattress",
          "obsessive",
          "paranoia",
          "rabble",
          "union",
          "volleyball",
      ]
      for word in words:
          if re.search(regex, word):
              results.append(word)

      return results

  my_expression = r"a"
  print get_matching_words(my_expression)
        </pre>
        <p>What would our output be for this example? Predict the following: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>r"v"</li>
          <li>r"^[aeiou]"</li>
          <li>r"(\w)\1"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Write regular expressions to find words that fit the following criteria, and use the above code to test your regex:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Contains "ss"</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Should match:</span> ['issue', 'mattress', 'obsessive']</span>
          <li>Contains a "b", any character, then another "b"</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Should match:</span> ['baby']</span>
          <li>Contains a "b", one or more characters, then another "b"</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Should match:</span> ['baby', 'baseball']</span>
          <li>Contains all five vowels in order, with any number of characters between them</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Should match:</span> ['facetious']</span>
          <li>Words ending in two vowels</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Should match:</span> ['issue', 'paranoia']</span>
          <li>Words that only contain the letters in "regular expressions"</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Should match:</span> ['issue', 'paranoia', 'union']</span>
          <li>Words that don't contain any of the letters in "regex" (try looking up the two meanings of "^" in regular expressions!)</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Should match:</span> ['baby', 'union']</span>
        </ol>
        <p>Look at the output below, and try to find a regex that will match those words and only those words:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>['baby', 'baseball', 'rabble']</li>
          <li>['baby', 'rabble']</li>
          <span><span class="emph">Hint:</span> These should remind you of questions 2 and 3 above.  What's the same?  What's different?</span>
          <li>['facetious', 'union']</li>
          <li>['issue', 'obsessive', 'rabble']</li>
          <li>['mattress', 'volleyball']</li>
        </ol>
